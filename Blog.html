<h1>#CIS363B Course Blog</h1>

<p>Hello Everyone! I am a student software developer creating his first blog about paintball and all my tips, tricks, and experiences. 
I have tons of other hobbies including exploring the woods, throwing darts, gaming it up on Xbox,
and many others.
I am interested in many aspects of software development, though not where I want to end up. I have a focus in
Web Game Programming so getting with a good company like Bethesda and Valve would really be the dream.  </p>
