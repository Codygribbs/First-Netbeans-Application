<h1>CIS363B Course Blog | Welcome </h1>

<p>Hello Everyone! I am a student software developer interested in many aspects of software development,
though not where I want to end up. I have a focus in Web Game Programming so getting with a good company like Bethesda and Valve 
would really be the dream.

This blog though will primarily be about my paintball tips, tricks, and experiences. 
I have tons of other hobbies including exploring the woods, throwing darts, gaming it up on Xbox, but this will be about the 
world of paintball.</p>

Course Project Overview
Website Design And Development Project
Objectives
The Course Project will be an ongoing accumulation of the Course Project Milestones due each week based on the assigned readings, lectures, and Labs. For the final product of this Course Project, you must complete a stand-alone website of around five to seven pages.

You may choose any content you desire for the site, such as a work-related site or personal interest site. In addition to criteria listed throughout the process, you will be evaluated on cohesiveness, accessibility, and design.

The overall objective of the Course Project is to give the opportunity to create a functioning website from initial conception, planning, development, testing, and publishing to a web server.

Guidelines
Students will work as individuals, not in teams.
There are seven milestones in the overall development.
Each student will select a project website idea and have it approved by the assigned faculty.
Week 1: Site Selection And Proposal
Create a Project Proposal document stating the basic elements you will include in your website. Include a cover sheet with your name, course, and week number. The body of your report must include

site title;
developer;
rationale or focus of the site;
outline of main elements;
content;
target audience;
design considerations; and
limiting factors.
Upon completion, name your MS Word document as lastname_CIS363_projectWk1.
