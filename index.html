<h1>CIS363B Course Blog | Welcome </h1>

<p>Hello Everyone! I am a student software developer interested in many aspects of software development,
though not where I want to end up. I have a focus in Web Game Programming so getting with a good company like Bethesda and Valve 
would really be the dream.

This blog though will primarily be about my paintball tips, tricks, and experiences. 
I have tons of other hobbies including exploring the woods, throwing darts, gaming it up on Xbox, but this will be about the 
world of paintball.</p>
