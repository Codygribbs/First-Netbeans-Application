  CIS363B Course Blog | Welcome

  <p>
    Hello Everyone! I am a student software developer interested in many aspects of software development,
    though not where I want to end up. I have a focus in Web Game Programming so getting with a good company like Bethesda and Valve 
    would really be the dream.

    This blog though will primarily be about my paintball tips, tricks, and experiences. 
    I have tons of other hobbies including exploring the woods, throwing darts, gaming it up on Xbox, but this will be about the 
    world of paintball.
