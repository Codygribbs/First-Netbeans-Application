<p>Hello Everyone! I am a student software developer. 
I tons of hobbies including exploring the woods,paintball fights, throwing darts, gaming it up on Xbox,
and many others.
I am interested in many aspects of software development, though not where I want to end up. I have a focus in Web Game Programming so getting with a good company like Bethesda and Valve would really be the dream.  </p>
